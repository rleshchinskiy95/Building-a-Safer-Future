# Building-a-Safer-Future
Through thorough data analysis of Construction-Related Accident Reports collected 
from the NYC Department of Building database from 2019 - 2023, we will strive to 
gain more incites on the who, where, when and why injuries and fatalities are 
ocurring specifically in the New York Metropolitian area. Most importantly, how 
can using this data analysis inspire future construction reform, so that together
we can "Build a Safer Future" for construction workers and the public alike.
